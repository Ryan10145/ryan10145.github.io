Hi, I'm Ryan! I'm currently a senior at Union County Magnet High School in Scotch Plains, NJ.

This fall, I'm going to be attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I'm planning on studying Course 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering).

Besides computer science, I'm also interested in math, playing video games, solving Rubik's cubes, and much more!

## Internship at Stevens Institute of Technology

During the summers of 2018-2020, I was a research intern at the Life and Light Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken. While there, I helped write an algorithm for performing atmospheric correction on ocean satellite data, which helps calculate valuable parameters such as chlorophyll concentration and aerosol optical depth.

I presented my work at the Liberty Science Center during the Partners in Science Symposium. I was also a co-author of the following paper:
